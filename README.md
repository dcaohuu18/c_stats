# C_STATS

C_STATS is a learning analytics tool for instructors to quickly evaluate the performance of a class and see how that performance can be improved.
A live version can be viewed at: https://streamlit-c-stats.herokuapp.com/

## Installation

1. ```git clone``` this respository to your local machine.
2. Install all the dependencies listed in ```requirements.txt```. Many of these dependencies are installed when you install Streamlit, 
so you may want to have that installed first (please see [How to clean install Streamlit](https://docs.streamlit.io/en/stable/troubleshooting/clean-install.html)). 
It is also advised that you create a separate environment for this application.  

## Usage

From the terminal, run: ```$ streamlit run c_stats.py```. If you create an environment for this application, you need to activate that environment first. 
If you are using Ananconda, you can try: ```$ conda activate <c_stats_environment>```.
